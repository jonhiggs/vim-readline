" kill-region ()
" Kill the text in the current region. By default, this command is unbound.

" copy-region-as-kill ()
" Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked right
" away. By default, this command is unbound.

" copy-backward-word ()
" Copy the word before point to the kill buffer. The word boundaries are the
" same as backward-word. By default, this command is unbound.

" copy-forward-word ()
" Copy the word following point to the kill buffer. The word boundaries are
" the same as forward-word. By default, this command is unbound.

" yank (C-y)
" Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
"imap <C-y> <C-O>u

" yank-pop (M-y)
" Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top. You can only do this if the
" prior command is yank or yank-pop.
